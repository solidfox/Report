## An architecture for modularised, functional and large scale development

### Background and context

The work will be done at the company Evry as a response to their wishes but acknowledged difficulty in migrating a quite progressed and highly invested project for one of their clients (one of Sweden's large banks) from JavaScript to ClojureScript.

### Scientific question

The question will be along the lines of "What design patterns do we need to build purely functional, immutable state client-side applications on industry-grade scale with ultra-high modularisation without compromising current architectural benefits?"

The question is highly relevant within the Software Engineering field where the embracing of functional concepts in projects like React have been brought about a new appreciation of FP and immutability and shown these concept's abilities to enable faster iteration on new and more complex ideas and greater confidence in the codebase.

The traditional go-to response for large-scale development has been to modularise through OOP-paradigm. But with the ever-rising popularity of the functional paradigm and immutability, the methods we use for scaling up OOP does not always apply anymore and work is needed to find corresponding wisdom in the functional paradigm.

### Method

The method of study will be to first analyse the existing codebase and identify the architectural requirements or requests that it currently fulfils. An attempt will then be made at reconstructing at least part of the same codebase in ClojureScript while maintaining all requirements and a maximal number of requests. This will yield one or more results that are either able or unable to fulfil as many or more requirements and requests as the original system. Based on these design patterns will be extracted and discussion will be made on ideas toward patterns that may help fulfil any remaining requests.

### The student's suitability

The project is based in the popular course "Patterns for Large-Scale Development" which I attended. I also have a passion for software engineering and functional programming that seems to be somewhat out of the ordinary as I tend to spend too much time writing even the quickest of machine learning labs in a somewhat beautiful and simple way.

### The supervisor

Tomas Ekholm should need no further introduction since he's a rare case of being both a professor at KTH and a Software Architect at Evry.

### Resources

See the part on the method. A lot of effort is also currently being put into similar endeavours and the concept of design patterns is nothing new.

### Eligibility

I currently have 64.5 credits from advanced courses, including "DA2205 Vetenskapsteori och vetenskaplig metodik". I have a couple of assignments left in Japanese as well as a course in "Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web" to fully fulfil my requirements for graduation.
