> An architecture for modularised, functional and large scale development

## Background and context

The work will be done at the company Evry as a response to their wishes to, but acknowledged difficulty in, migrating a quite progressed and highly invested frontend project for one of their clients (one of Sweden's large banks) from JavaScript to ClojureScript.

## Scientific question

The question will be along the lines of "What design patterns do we need to build purely functional, immutable state client-side applications on industry-grade scale with ultra-high modularisation without compromising current architectural benefits?"

The question is highly relevant within the Software Engineering field where the embracing of functional concepts in projects like React have brought about a new level of appreciation of FP and immutability and shown these concepts' abilities to enable faster iteration on new and more complex ideas as well as greater confidence in the codebase.

The traditional go-to response for large-scale development has been to modularise through the OOP-paradigm. But with the ever-rising popularity of the functional paradigm and immutability, the methods we use for scaling up OOP does not always apply anymore and work is needed to find corresponding wisdom in the functional paradigm.

## Method

The method of study will be to first analyse the existing codebase and identify the architectural requirements or requests that it currently fulfils as well as those it would like to fulfil. An attempt will then be made at reconstructing at least part of the same codebase in ClojureScript while maintaining all requirements and a maximal number of requests. This will yield one or more solutions that are either able or unable to fulfil as many or more requirements and requests as the original system. Based on these solutions design patterns will be extracted and discussion will be made on ideas toward patterns that may help fulfil any remaining requests.

## The student's suitability

The project is based in the popular course "Patterns for Large-Scale Development" which I have taken. I also have a passion for software engineering and functional programming that seems to be somewhat out of the ordinary as I tend to spend too much time trying to write even the quickest of machine learning labs in a somewhat beautiful and simple way.

## The supervisor

Tomas Ekholm should need no further introduction since he is a rare case of being both a professor at KTH and a Software Architect at Evry. Tomas would like to be supervisor for Every and recommends his colleagues Stefan Nilsson, Viggo Kann and Philip Haller as supervisors from KTH.

## Resources

See the section on the method. A lot of effort is also currently being put into similar endeavours and the concept of design patterns is nothing new.

## Eligibility

I currently have 64.5 credits from advanced courses, including "DA2205 Vetenskapsteori och vetenskaplig metodik". I have a couple of assignments left in Japanese as well as a course in "Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web" to fully fulfil my requirements for graduation.
